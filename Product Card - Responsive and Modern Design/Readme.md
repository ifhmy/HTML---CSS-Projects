# Product Card - Responsive and Modern Design

This project is a simple, elegant product card built using modern web technologies: HTML5 and CSS3. It demonstrates how to create a clean, minimal, and responsive design using **Flexbox** for layout and CSS media queries for responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops, providing an optimized viewing experience on all devices.

- **Flexbox Layout:**  
  Utilizes CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and efficient container that arranges the image and text side-by-side on larger screens, and stacks them vertically on smaller screens for better readability.

- **Modern HTML and CSS:**  
  The project uses semantic HTML5 elements and modern CSS features, adhering to best practices for maintainability and accessibility.

- **Clean and Minimal Style:**  
  The visual design emphasizes readability and aesthetics with balanced spacing, soft colors, and legible typography.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **Flexbox:** For flexible and adaptive layout control.
- **Media Queries:** To apply different styles based on screen width.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the `images` folder contains the necessary product images and icons.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the product card.

## Code Highlights

- The `.card` container uses `display: flex` to arrange child elements in a row on desktops.
- The `@media` query changes the layout to column direction for screen widths under 600px.
- `object-fit: cover` on images ensures they fill their containers nicely without distortion.
- Flexbox properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` help center content elegantly.
